# SDE-OIE
Sentence Difficulty Estimation for Open Information Extraction is an OIE system for automatic estimation of relation extraction 
difficulty by developing some difficulty classifiers. We train some classifiers which apply a diverse set of features and assign 
each input sentence to the proper OIE extractor based on difficulty score. Therefore, they would combine the advantages of shallow 
and deep OIE extractors while attempting to avoid the limitations of each.
